## What?

Representative in Congress

## Where? 

The [Ninth (9th) Congressional District](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Illinois's+9th+Congressional+District,+IL/@42.1179813,-88.1580342,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x880fcecd4b9e4075:0x51fe97f66e3e7d48!8m2!3d42.0768723!4d-87.7960067!16zL20vMGgyOWN0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTExMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) in [Illinois](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?mid=1qfnRiuOZ3yok6WGvBHZ9P6u3EMy_LwRv&ll=42.11806388762322%2C-87.9932285&z=11)

## Why? 

Congress is broken. 

[I believe that when you see something broken, it is your purpose to fix it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam).

I have had no desire to seek such a public position - much of my career has been talking to a computer - however I find myself moved to do something to correct what I see is wrong in government, especially in the "people's house", the House of Representatives.

I hope to win your vote.

# Footnotes

[1] You can often find me at local open mics like Wednesdays at [Flaco's Tacos - Granville](https://www.flacostacosonline.com) or the last Monday of the month at [Sketchbook Brewing in Evanston](https://www.sketchbookbrewing.com)

[2] My friends recently said that I often talk about food and music. Unsurprisingly, I volunteer for farmers at the local markets and places like the [Old Town School of Folk Music](http://oldtownschool.org/) or [Merlefest](https://merlefest.org).
