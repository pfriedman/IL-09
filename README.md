### Why? 

Congress is broken. 

[I believe that when you see something broken, it is your purpose to fix it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam).

I have had no desire to seek such a public position - much of my career has been talking to a computer - however I find myself moved to do something to correct what I see is wrong in government, especially in the "people's house", the House of Representatives.

I hope to win your vote.
