## What?

Representative in Congress

## Where? 

The Ninth (9th) Congressional District in Illinois [4][5]

## Why? 

Congress is broken. I believe that when you see something broken, it is your purpose to fix it. [6]

I have had no desire to seek such a public position - much of my career has been talking to a computer - however I find myself moved to do something to correct what I see is wrong in government, especially in the "people's house", the House of Representatives.

I hope to win your vote.

[2] You can often find me at local open mics like Wednesdays at Flaco's Tacos or the last Monday of the month at Sketchbook Brewing in Evanston

[3] My friends recently said that I often talk about food and music. Unsurprisingly, I volunteer for farmers at the local markets and places like the Old Town School of Folk Music or Merlefest.
