# Questionnaires

Here are my responses to questionnaires I have been given by various organizations. These are questionnaires where I was given a word count and I could express my views in my own words. I am excluding the large number of questionnaires that limited my response to a multiple choice or (more often) a boolean yes/no/omit response.
