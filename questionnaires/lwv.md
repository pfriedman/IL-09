### Questions and Answers

The League of Women Voters of Evanston requested a response by February 18th, 2026.

**Questions are in bold.** My responses follow.

**What, if anything, should Congress do to ensure quality healthcare at an affordable cost for all?**

Let's replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with something that could work. Bernie Sanders has cried for years that the United States should have "Medicare for All. Conservative thinkers recently have riffed on that idea and proposed "Medicare Advantage for All". A natural liberal/conservative split between a public system and a private system. In true competitive manner, let's try both. This would require transitioning to a universal system where all citizens are covered by Medicare, with options to choose between traditional government-run, single-payer insurance and private Medicare Advantage plans. The ACA fell short in its ability to provide near universal coverage at an affordable rate. It's past time to try something different.

**What measures, if any, do you believe need to be in place to ensure the long term viability of the Social Security System?**

Any solution I support must meet three tests: it must keep our promise to current seniors, protect middle‑ and lower‑income workers, and place Social Security on a stable, long‑term path for our children and grandchildren. First, I would oppose any cuts to benefits for current retirees or those close to retirement, who have organized their lives around the existing rules. Instead, Congress should act soon so changes for younger workers can be phased in gradually and predictably. For younger Americans, I support a balanced package of reforms. That includes modestly adjusting the benefit formula for higher‑income retirees so those who can most afford it see slower benefit growth, while middle‑ and lower‑income workers are protected.

**Data centers drive high electricity production and transmission needs and stress regional freshwater systems. Do you support any specific environmental measures at the federal level to address the impact of data centers?**

Yes, I have three specific proposals regarding data centers. 1.) All Data Centers need to add an additional electrical source & incorporate them with the existing electrical grid. 2.) Centers using a greater percentage of electricity than the general populace must pay a higher rate at a set percentage above the residential or commercial buildings in the area. 3.) Support closed-loop systems to reduce water loss through evaporation and add incentives to re-use that heated water to heat nearby homes and other productive radiant heat uses. Government's role is to support the growth of these new technologies while setting safeguards so that the residents are not so effected as to diminish their quality of life.

**Some voters are concerned that there has been overreach in the executive branch of government. Do you agree, and if so, are there any action steps you plan to take to address this?**

I share the concern many voters have about executive overreach. Our Constitution was built on a system of checks and balances, and when any branch of government starts taking on more authority than it was meant to, that balance gets out of alignment. Traditionally the Republican party strongly believes in limited government. That means respecting the rule of law and ensuring that Congress keeps its rightful role as the branch that writes the laws and oversees how they’re carried out. In recent years, both Republican and Democratic administrations have relied too heavily on executive orders and agency rule‑making to advance agendas that should be debated and decided in Congress. Congress need to reassert it's Article One Powers.

**What federal actions, if any, do you favor to address the shortage of housing and increasing numbers of people experiencing homelessness?**

Every person deserves a safe place to call home. To tackle the housing shortage and homelessness, we need federal policies that help—not hinder—local communities. Washington must empower local communities—not micromanage them—to expand housing supply and address homelessness. I’ll work to cut needless regulations that drive up costs, support incentives for builders to create affordable homes, and expand access to mental health and addiction care. By working with local nonprofits, faith groups, and private partners, we can provide real help and second chances for people who want to rebuild their lives.

**For a given issue on which you feel strongly, and believe your constituents do as well, how would you describe your legislative approach regarding standing firm versus finding middle ground? If there were a "compromise spectrum," where would you lie on it, and why?**

I consider myself a centrist on the spectrum of compromise. I will fully represent the Ninth Congressional District and work with all 434 colleagues in the House to find common ground on key issues like affordability, immigration, and taxes. While I remain open to cooperation, I will never sacrifice my morals or integrity and will call out corruption when I see it. Our district, though gerrymandered to favor Democrats, shares common goals — reducing crime, improving infrastructure, supporting small businesses. Hyper-partisanship has paralyzed Congress, but most Americans want the same things: good jobs, honest leadership, and unity. Only by working together can we build lasting progress.
