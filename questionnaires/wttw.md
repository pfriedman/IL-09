### Questions and Answers

WTTW and Chicago Tonight requested a response by February 6th, 2026.

**Questions are in bold.** My responses follow.

**Why are you running?**

  To answer the question being asked these days: "What did you do during this time to make a difference?"
  
  I ran for Congress to be your Representative in the Illinois Ninth Congressional District - a place I dearly love. 
  
  Even in a district drawn against me, I believe fresh ideas can still find support. I am running to have a platform for a short tine to bring up some novel ideas that might be implemented in the near future. 
  
  I believe that the People's House, the House of Representatives, is in desperate need of repair and that the Article One powers bestowed upon Congress need to be re-energized and exercised fully. To do so, I believe that Congress, the House in particular, can be strengthened through four essential reforms: 
  1) end gerrymandering of Congressional Districts; 
  2) set term limits for members of Congress in the House and Senate; 
  3) set an age limit of 75 for any federal representative in any branch - legislative, judicial, or executive, and 
  4) re-legislate the Citizen's United court ruling to restrict the amount of money spent in politics.
  
  These measures will allow legislators to focus on fixing problems rather than raising money or pandering to party leaders. Together we can restore the House to serve the people again. 
  
  

**What do you think is the most pressing issue facing your constituents and how do you plan on addressing it?**

  The most pressing issue facing the people of the Ninth District is the rising cost of living. From groceries and gas to housing and utilities, prices have climbed faster than incomes, leaving many families struggling to keep up. Since 2020, overall consumer costs have risen by more than 17%, while average wages in Illinois have grown by less than half that rate. That gap is putting real pressure on working families, small businesses, and seniors on fixed incomes.
  
  We need practical solutions that make life affordable again. That means putting federal spending on a sustainable path to ease inflation, ensuring Washington lives within its means just like families do. It also means expanding domestic energy supply and investing in modern infrastructure to reduce production and transportation costs that drive up prices.
  
  I’ll also work to deliver targeted tax relief for middle-income households and small businesses, making it easier to save, invest, and hire. And on housing, we need to remove outdated regulations and streamline permitting so local builders can create more affordable options for young families and renters. We can also leverage tax codes to support families and first time home buyers purchase homes instead of speculators.
  
  My approach is simple: focus on fiscal responsibility, economic growth, and common-sense reforms that reduce costs for everyone. Families in the Illinois Ninth (9th) Congressional District deserve the opportunity to build better lives without being priced out of their own communities.


**What is one unique challenge your district faces and how do you plan to address it?**

  Our district’s unique challenge is that it is so gerrymandered, so safe for one party that too many voices are ignored and too many real problems get brushed aside. In running for Congress, I wanted to give some people a voice, and others a choice. When elections are effectively decided in one primary, you don’t get honest debates about how to make our streets safer, how to keep housing and groceries affordable, how to confront rising antisemitism and all forms of hate, or how to support small businesses and working families.

  I’m running to change that. My plan is to bring balance and accountability back to this seat by focusing on practical solutions instead of ideological slogans: empowering law enforcement while respecting civil rights, supporting policies that lower taxes and reduce regulatory burdens on small businesses, and demanding that federal dollars we already send to Washington actually come back home to improve our local transit, schools, and infrastructure.

  Most importantly, I will be a representative who shows up in every part of the district and listens, even when we disagree. Our challenge is lack of genuine representation. My answer is to be an independent, accessible voice who fights for everyone in the Illinois Ninth (9th) Congressional District, not just the loudest faction of one party.
  
**What do you think federal immigration reform should look like?**

  For more than a decade Thomas Friedman (no relation) has used the metaphor of a "high wall with a big gate" as the best way to address our border even as the issues change. Our border policy should match this metaphor. 
  
  I love it when a right leaning organization like the Cato Institute agrees with a self described "pro-globalization Democrat" like Friedman. When people with differing perspectives agree with specific proposals to address a significant problem I know that there is a path forward to make progress on the issue. 
  
  I fall on the side where we should build the "big gate" first as argued by the Cato Institue. That is, we need to expand legal immigration (e.g., more worker visas, a streamlined asylum process, or modernized guest-worker programs) which significantly cuts down the number of illegal immigrants. As for a "high wall", I would like to emphasize the metaphor rather than a concrete wall; we need to control immigration via border controls and repatriation measures. 
  
  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) needs to be completely reformed. The military-style posture of some DHS operations is counterproductive and damages public trust.. Federal officers should not be entering cities and municipalities without the support of local authorities. 
  
  Quoting Friedman from his 2021 article, our border policy "requires a tough-minded balance between hardheartedness and compassion". America must remain both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. With a secure border and a modern, fair immigration system, we can be both.

**How should Congress address the rising costs of health care?**

  We need to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with a more flexible system that actually drives down costs and expands choice.

  Rising healthcare costs are straining families, small businesses, and our national budget. The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage but failed to make healthcare truly affordable or sustainable. Premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs have continued to rise while competition among insurers has declined.

  Congress should replace the ACA with a system that ensures universal access to basic coverage through a combination of public and private options. One promising model is a “Medicare and Medicare Advantage for All” framework. Every American would be guaranteed access to a basic set of benefits under traditional Medicare. Those who prefer private-sector innovation and efficiency could choose from competing Medicare Advantage-style plans offered by private insurers.

  This approach would preserve consumer choice, drive competition, and utilize existing Medicare infrastructure instead of building new bureaucracies. It would also empower Americans to make their own healthcare decisions while ensuring that every citizen has affordable coverage. The goal isn’t more government control — it’s a sustainable, market-driven model that lowers costs, expands access, and improves quality outcomes for all Americans.


**What approach would you take on tax policy and what is your top priority?**

  My tax policy approach is to cut the cost of living for working and middle‑class families in this district while forcing government at every level to live within its means and be transparent about how it spends your money. My top priority is to deliver real, visible relief from punishing property and income taxes in Cook County and Illinois and to protect the federal tax relief you already rely on.
  
  Mine would be a common-sense approach viewed through, what Oren Cass and others call, the "cost of thriving" index. That is, can an American worker support theirself and their family. Tax and spending policy should be explicitly judged by whether it makes supporting a family easier, not by abstract metrics or across-the-board cuts.
  
  Specifically, I would redirect corporate rate cuts toward robust family benefits such as the Family Income Supplemental Credit which is designed to replace the current Child Tax Credit (CTC) with larger, monthly, per-child payments for working families. I would also pair working and middle-class tax relief with credible spending cuts and focused revenue increases to prove that conservatives can govern responsibly. No more "voodoo economics".
  
  Every tax vote I take would be judged by a simple test: does this make it easier for a working or middle‑class family in the Illinois Ninth Congressional District to stay, save, and build a future here, or does it make it harder?


**Is the House currently using its oversight powers in the way it should be? What areas of government need more or less oversight?**


  Congress is the first among equals. The Founders placed the legislative branch in Article One of the Constitution because it is the people’s voice and the guardian against government overreach. I’m running for Congress to restore that balance of power and to fully exercise the responsibilities Article One entrusts to the House.

  In recent decades, the executive branch has accumulated authority that rightfully belongs to the legislature. Federal agencies now issue regulations with the force of law, often without accountability to the people’s representatives. That’s not how our constitutional republic was meant to function.

  Oversight once expanded to protect individual rights from state abuse. But today, the federal government has tipped the balance, substituting its judgment for that of states and local communities. As President Reagan warned, Washington too often interferes “where it has not been invited.”

  The House must reclaim meaningful oversight in two ways: first, by acting as a real check on executive actions that circumvent Congress; second, by demanding transparency in how taxpayer dollars are spent. Every federal agency should answer for how it uses public funds—whether in defense, domestic programs, or foreign aid.

  Oversight should never be political theater. It should restore trust in government by ensuring honesty, efficiency, and constitutional limits. When Congress properly exercises its Article One powers, it not only checks the other branches—it protects the liberty of every American.
  

**What is the most pressing foreign policy issue facing the country and what role should the House play in dealing with it?**

  The most pressing foreign policy issue is protecting American security and prosperity in a world where China, Russia, Iran, and transnational cartels are simultaneously testing U.S. resolve. This shows up in rising tensions in the Indo‑Pacific, war in Europe, threats to global energy and supply chains, and the flow of fentanyl, crime, and potential terrorism across our own border. If America projects weakness or confusion, we invite more aggression, endanger our allies, and ultimately put American families and our economy at risk.

  Roman writer Vegetius wrote - _si vis pacem, para bellum_ - if you want peace, prepare for war. The House must lead in restoring peace through strength: strong borders, a strong military, and firm support for key allies so we deter war instead of reacting to it. That means using the power of the purse to fund our military, intelligence, and homeland security responsibly while enforcing strict oversight; passing targeted sanctions and authorizations that hold China, Russia, Iran, and cartels accountable without writing blank checks; and conditioning any foreign aid on clear U.S. interests, accountability, and a serious border‑security strategy. Above all, the House must reassert Congress’s constitutional role so no administration can commit our troops to major conflicts without coming to the people’s representatives with a clear mission, a realistic plan to win, and an honest vote.

**How do you view AI and the role the government should play in its regulation?**

  The advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been fascinating and full of promise. Also, AI is going to incredibly alter the US and global economy. The focus of the government is to foster an environment where AI will grow to benefit the American people, while at the same time protecting US Citizens from the economic, environmental, and social dangers attributed to AI.

  I think the market should determine the size, scope of change, and uses of AI. Many people will be doing amazing things in the coming years assisted by AI. Government’s role isn’t to control innovation, but to set clear guardrails that protect Americans while keeping the U.S. the global leader in AI.
  
 We can’t ignore the social and mental health challenges that come with powerful new tools. In Congress, I'll work with mental health professionals to create legislative solutions.

  Economically, many workers are going to be displaced. The US Government must work with businesses to help plan and train the American workforce for the jobs of the future. 
  
  Finally, AI uses a lot of energy and natural resources. Congress needs to pass regulations concerning energy use and data center growth. We need to make certain there is a large enough energy supply to meet the demand without having costs skyrocket as well as ensure the communities are not bled of their natural resources.

  If we get this right, the U.S. can lead the world in responsible innovation, creating new industries and opportunities for generations to come.

**How would you describe the current state of your party and what changes or new approaches would you like to see your party adopt?** 

  The Republican Party remains rooted in an enduring truth — that freedom, responsibility, and limited government form the foundation of a strong and prosperous nation. Yet recently, Congress has too often ceded its constitutional authority to the Executive Branch, allowing major decisions to be made by executive order rather than through the deliberation and consensus our system was designed to encourage.

  The hard work of legislating is never easy, but it is essential. When we debate, negotiate, and find principled common ground, we create laws that last and policies that serve the people — not the party in power. That should be our standard once again.

  I believe it’s time for the Republican Party to renew its commitment to those core ideals: restoring balance between the federal government and the states, empowering individuals over institutions, and strengthening the voice of the citizen over the reach of bureaucracy.

  Our goal should not be simply to oppose or undo what others have built, but to chart a constructive path forward — one that rekindles faith in America’s promise and demonstrates that principled leadership can still unite rather than divide. The work ahead is challenging, but it’s worthy of the country we all love.
