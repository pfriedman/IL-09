# Establish Age Restrictions

Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has called for an [age limit](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/rahm-emanuel-age-limit-75.html) for Congress, President, and Judges. This wasn’t one of my initial ideas for fixing Congress - but I’ve bundled this one into my Fix Congress proposals because it fits in so well.

I completely agree with the sentiment - thank you for your service, please enjoy retirement.

```
Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don’t stand in the doorway
Don’t block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin’
Will soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin’
