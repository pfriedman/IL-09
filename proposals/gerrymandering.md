# End Gerrymandering

There is an [existing proposal in the Senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3750/text) regarding the congressional redistricting process. 

The job for which I am applying - Representative in Congress for the Illinois Ninth (9th) Congressional District - is for one of the most diverse districts in the nation, and one of the most Gerrymandered. The [Gerrymandering Project out of Princeton](https://gerrymander.princeton.edu/redistricting-report-card/?planId=receAu6OJuYEkxKjG) grades Illinois an **_F_**. I believe that this extreme gerrymandering throughout the United States is simply un-American. 

Even though there is unlikely a one size fits all approach for each state, there are several measurable metrics we can use to which all independent commissions must meet to reasonably ensure fair Congressional Districts.

## Proposed Amendment 
### (based on Amendment passed in Michigan)

A proposed constitutional amendment to establish a commission of citizens with exclusive authority to adopt district boundaries for the United States Congressional Districts for all States for the United States House of Representatives every 10 years after the number of Congressional Districts are decided by the United States Census.
