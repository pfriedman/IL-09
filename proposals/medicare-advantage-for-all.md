# Medicare for All vs Medicare Advantage for All

Why not both?

### Premise

Milton Friedman: "A major source of objection to a free economy is precisely that it ... gives people what they want instead of what a particular group thinks they ought to want. Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself."

Paul Krugman: "An Insurance Company With An Army" [1]


Let's agree with Mr. Krugman's assessment that for the United States "[t]he vast bulk of its spending goes to the big five: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, defense, and interest on the debt."

Mr. Friedman (no relation) argued for a free market - the market will supply the demands of the consumer. 

### Proposal

Let's replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with something that could work. Bernie Sanders has cried for years that the United States should have *Medicare for All*. Conservative thinkers recently have riffed on that idea and proposed *Medicare Advantage for All*. A natural liberal/conservative split between a public system and a private system. 

In true competitive manner, let's try both. This would require transitioning to a universal system where all citizens are covered by Medicare, with options to choose between traditional government-run, single-payer insurance and private Medicare Advantage plans. The ACA fell short in its ability to provide near universal coverage at an affordable rate. It's past time to try something different.
