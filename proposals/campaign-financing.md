# Restrict Campaign Financing

[American Promise](https://americanpromise.net) has gone further in the Constitutional Amendment progress that I thought had been happening to this date. Please read their [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://americanpromise.net/faq/) page to see how far along they have gotten in the Amendment Process.

Their focus is to re-legislate a series of Supreme Court decisions — most notably, _Buckley v. Valeo_ and _Citizens United v. FEC_ — that have stripped lawmakers’ ability to decide whether and how to set limits on political spending.

My race in particular has been subject to this type of “dark money” campaign and it is manifestly un-democratic. Restricting Campaign Spending will drastically alter politics in the United States moving us forward into becoming the country we wish it to be.

I agree with their slogan: An Amendment Era is Upon Us.
