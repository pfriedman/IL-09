# Set Term Limits

The following proposals are ideas I wrote before having been contacted by [U.S. Term Limits](https://termlimits.com) to sign their pledge. 

We disagree on the set number of terms but I have seen in campaigning that Term Limits are very much desired, to limit the years a Senator or Representative can serve in that position. I have said on this campaign many times that the job for which I am applying - Representative in Congress - is a two-year gig for a reason. 

## Proposed Amendments

### Senate

No person shall be elected to the office of Senator of a particular State more than thrice, and no person who has held the office of Senator, or acted as Sentor, for more than three years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of Sentor more than twice. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of Sentor when this Article was proposed by Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of Sentor, or acting as Sentor, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of Sentor or acting as Sentor during the remainder of such term.

This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress. [1] 

### House

No person shall be elected to the office of Representative in Congress of a particular State more than ninefold, and no person who has held the office of Representative in Congress, or acted as Sentor, for more than one years of a term to which some other person was elected Representative in Congress shall be elected to the office of Sentor more than eightfold. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of Representative in Congress when this Article was proposed by Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of Representative in Congress, or acting as Representative in Congress, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of Representative in Congress or acting as Representative in Congress during the remainder of such term.

This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress. [1] 


### President

No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than thrice (or twice consecutively), and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of President more than thrice (or twice consecutively). But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.

This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress. [1] 

### Supreme Court

TODO - research pro/cons for Supreme Court terms limits - does the freedom of thought that comes from life term outweigh any benefit of consistent change?

Restructuring proposals of the Supreme Court might be more effective than either term limits or lengthening the bench.
