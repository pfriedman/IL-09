# Marijuana 

On December 18th, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order along the lines of my original suggestion: 

re-schedule cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III. 

The next logical step is to change federal laws so that those businesses running in States that have legalized either Medical or Recreational cannabis are able to run as legal businesses in the eyes of the government, specifically focusing on Capital. We need to changes laws regarding taxes, financing, and financial services (e.g. banking, credit card processing, &c.).
