# Constitution .git

One of the more interesting developments in computer development was the creation of distributed source control. 

Amending a document and creating a history is one of the more basic aspects of writing software. 

I propose that we put the Constitution under source control and re-assess our manner of making amendments to the Constitution.

Oh, look, I already started on the project. [https://github.com/pfriedman/United-States-Constitution](https://github.com/pfriedman/United-States-Constitution)
