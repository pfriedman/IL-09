### Tariffs

A tariff must be ratified by the Congress within a set number of days after the President announces or sets the tariff. The date of the tariff is set upon the first pronouncment of the tariff by the President. The date and the country at this point are fixed; any changes to the tariff percentage or products do not change the fixed date. 

Congress will then be obligated to either 1) set the tariff percentages against products for that country or 2) let the tariff expire after a set number of days (to be determined).
